What follows will be a course description from the University of California at San Diego.
I need you to extract some data from it in the following schema:
{
    number: string,
    name: string,
    description: string,
    prerequisites: [string]
}

For example, take the following input:

CSE 100. Advanced Data Structures (4)
High-performance data structures and supporting algorithms.
Use and implementation of data structures like (un)balanced trees,
graphs, priority queues, and hash tables. Also, memory management,
pointers, recursion. Theoretical and practical performance analysis,
both average case and amortized. Uses C++ and STL.
Recommended preparation: background in C or C++ programming.
Prerequisites: CSE 21 or MATH 154 or MATH 158 or MATH 184 or MATH 188 and CSE 12 and CSE 15L and CSE 30 or ECE 15;
restricted to undergraduates.
Graduate students will be allowed as space permits.
Students may not receive credit for both CSE 100R and CSE 100.

The correct output in this case is:

{
    number: "CSE 100"
    name: "Advanced Data Structures"
}
